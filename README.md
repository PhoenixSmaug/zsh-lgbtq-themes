# Oh-My-Zsh LGBTQ* Themes

![Example Transgender Theme in Gnome Terminal](https://i.ibb.co/tbdT1Lc/terminal.png)

Cute hearts to show your queer pride in your Zsh terminal!

## Setup:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PhoenixSmaug/zsh-lgbtq-themes.git
cp zsh-lgbtq-themes/themes/* ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes
```
(Or just manually copy the `.zsh-theme` files you want into `~/.oh-my-zsh/themes`)

Set the theme you want in `~/zshrc` via `ZSH_THEME="[name]"` (example `ZSH_THEME="lgbtq"`). You can also have one randomly selected at each instance start with `ZSH_THEME_RANDOM_CANDIDATES=( "[name1]" "[name2]" )`.
